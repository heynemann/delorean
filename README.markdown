Why another document database?
==============================

To be honest, because I can. I wanted to improve my programming skills in several different aspects and a database seems like a *REALLY* good opportunity in doing so.

Creating a database requires learning more about HTTP (the db is RESTful), Security, Performance, data structure algorithms and of course the languages involved (Ruby for the DB, Python for the first client).
